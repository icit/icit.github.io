<h2>Call for Papers: Early Research Achievements (ERA) Track</h2>

<h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
The goal of the early research achievements (ERA) track is to provide researchers and practitioners with a forum for presenting promising ideas in early stages of research. These ideas do not require a strong empirical evaluation. The 2016 ERA track aims to provide constructive feedback to guide authors from their initial ideas and limited evaluations toward solid ICSME 2017 papers with strong empirical underpinnings. The topics of interest for the ERA track are the same as for the main research track (i.e., all topics related to the research and practice of software maintenance and evolution).
</p>
 
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
All submissions that meet the submission criteria (see below) and fit the scope of the conference will be reviewed by three members of the ERA track program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of soundness, importance of contribution, originality, quality and consistency of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and evaluation (if available). Special emphasis will be placed on the originality and timeliness of the proposed contribution &mdash; a complete evaluation of the proposed idea is not required. Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without being reviewed. Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to the ERA track must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2016.
</p>
