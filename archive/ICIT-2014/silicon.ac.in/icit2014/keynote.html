<strong><h3>Model-Based Testing and Monitoring for Embedded Software</h3></strong>
<BR><BR>

<strong>Abstract:</strong><BR>
<p align="justify">
In many application domains, Simulink/Stateflow serves as a platform for model-based development of the 
reactive embedded code, that interacts with its environment in real-time fashion. The talk will present 
a model-based approach for testing Simulink/Stateflow code, based on its automated translation to input-output 
extended finite automaton (I/O-EFA), followed by automated test-generation, guaranteeing user-defined code as 
well as requirements coverage, and also support for automated test-execution and error-localization. While testing 
is useful for design-time error analysis, the talk will further discuss our model-based approach for run-time error 
monitoring, detection and localization. Monitoring at system level (as opposed to software level) is necessarily stochastic, 
and a more general I/O-Stochastic Hybrid Automaton (I/O-SHA) model is used, and condition is obtained for bounded-delay 
detectability, and achieving desired levels of false-positives/-negatives.

Ratnesh Kumar is a Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the Iowa State University, and 
prior to which he was with the ECE Dept. at the Univ. of Kentucky. He received B.Tech. in Electrical Eng. 
from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) in 1987, and M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical & Computer Engineering 
from the Univ. of Texas, Austin (UTAustin) in 1989 and 1991, respectively. Ratnesh's research interest spans sensors, 
networks, controls and software with application domains of cyberphysical (hybrid) systems, embedded and real-time systems, 
model-based software and web-services, power systems, energy harvesting, and sustainable agriculture. Ratnesh received Gold 
Medals from IITK, MCD Fellowship and Dissertation Award from UTAustin, Fellowships from NASA-Ames, Applied Research Lab-Penn 
State Univ, Idaho National Lab, and United Technologies Research Center, and several awards from NSF (including Research Initiation Award), 
DoE, ONR, General Motors, and Adobe. Ratnesh is a Fellow of the IEEE for contributions to discrete event system modeling, control, diagnosis 
and applications. Ratnesh has served on a number of editorial boards for IEEE and ACM, has been General/Program Chair and also given 
keynote talks at IEEE and ACM conferences.

<strong>Abstract:</strong><BR>
<p align="justify">
In search for novel technologies, no such material has aroused so much interest other than carbon nanomaterials since the discovery of one-dimensional carbon nanotube in 1991 by Iijima. The carbon nanotube (CNT) has excellent electrical, mechanical and thermal properties which has made the CNT one of the promising materials for applications in nanoelectronics and micro/nano-systems. Recent work on analytical modeling equations describing the current transport in carbon nanotube field effect transistors compatible with VLSI CAD tools such as Cadence/Verilog-AMS and interconnects will be presented for use in design of emerging logic devices similar to CMOS design style, molecular sensing and bio-electronics circuits. The two-dimensional material graphene has demonstrated exceptional electronic properties such as the current density 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the copper interconnect used in current silicon technologies, and exhibited potential for energy harvesting devices, displays, sensors and storage cell batteries.  Recent work on both analytical and computer-aided modeling of novel graphene transistors for RF, and ultra-high performance integrated circuit design will be presented.
